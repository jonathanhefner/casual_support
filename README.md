# casual_support

Utility methods as extensions to Ruby core objects.  Stuff I want in Active Support.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'casual_support'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install casual_support


## Development

Run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).


## License

The gem is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
